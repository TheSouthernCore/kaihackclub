# Hackpad Macropad

This is a product I made in colaboration with Hackclub Blueprint and AMD

Its a simple Macropad that includes 2 RGB LEDs and 4 Keys

You will need a SEEED STUDIO RP2040 Microcontroller for this to work.

Both the STLs for the cacing and the PCB files are here. You need KiCad to view the PCB and need the SEEED STUDIO extensions aswell.  

Thank you for looking at my project :)
